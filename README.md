# Masters_thesis_scripts

This repository includes every code I have used both to automize and run MolDStruct, but also for analysis. 

As of now, separate codes were created to automize the MolDStruct pipeline depending on what dataset that was used. The same was done for analysis of these cases.

An additional script was created for singular MolDStruct runs for any preferred protein structure that can be downloaded from the Proten Data Bank. Local pdb- or gro-fiels can also be implemented.

Preferred laser parameters (except focal point) are asked for when running the code. You must have MolDStruct downloaded beforehand and change the directory pathway.
